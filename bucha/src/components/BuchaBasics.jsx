          Can I use frozen fruit instead of fresh fruit to flavor my kombucha?
        </p>
        <p>
          - Absolutely! Frozen or thawed, measure out the amount you need and
          add it to the kombucha for your second fermentation cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does the kombucha need to be refrigerated during the second
          fermentation cycle?
        </p>
        <p>
          - No. Store the kombucha in in the same location as you did for the
          first fermentation cycle.
