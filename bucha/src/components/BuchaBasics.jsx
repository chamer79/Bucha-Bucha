        <p>What is a scoby?</p>
        <p>- It’s a living culture of bacteria and yeast which is used to make kombucha.</p>
        <p>How much to starter liquid should I add to the first fermentation cycle?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 quart:  1/2c stater liquid</li>
          <li>1/2 gallon : 1c starter liquid</li>
          <li>1 gallon batch: 2s starter liquid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Can I use frozen fruit instead of fresh fruit to flavor my kombucha?</p>
        <p>- Absolutely! Frozen or thawed, measure out the amount you need and add it to the kombucha for your second fermentation cycle.</p>
        <p>Does the kombucha need to be refrigerated during the second fermentation cycle?</p>
        <p>-	No.  Store the kombucha in in the same location as you did for the first fermentation cycle.</p>
        <p>Any books that you recommend for additional kombucha care and recipes?</p>
        <p>-	Highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Kombucha-Flavoring-Fermented/dp/161212433X"
          target="_blank">‘The Big Book of Kombucha’</a>. Not only does it have flavoring recipes, it teaches
          you the dos and don’ts of kombucha brewing, as well as how to identify a good scoby from a bad scoby.</p>
