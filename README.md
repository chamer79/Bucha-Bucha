## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:  Well organized, and good at working in a timely matter.

### Weaknesses:  Being obsessed (spending too much time) with troubleshooting a problem by myself. (Had an instance where I lost track of time trying to troubleshoot a problen during my last project.) Need to set a timer for troubleshooting; if I am unable to correct it withing the designated time, I wll seek assistance.

### Opportunities:  Incorporating some of my PMVPs; if not all of them.

### Threats:  Going down that 'troubleshooting obsessed' rabbit hole.
